New Zealand River Monitoring Tool - Proof of Concept

This tool has been built using the Shiny package from R, and published to a Shiny server.

The tool uses data from the New Zealand Environmental Integrated Data Infrastructure Project, to show the locations of river flow monitoring stations in four counties in New Zealand, along with current and historical flow data at each site.

The tool can be accessed here: [https://swirrl.shinyapps.io/NZ_River_Flow/]
